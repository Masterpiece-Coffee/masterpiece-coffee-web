      We love coffee and take great pride in our dedication to the roast. All of
      our coffees are roasted in a small batch drum roaster and all are finished
      with the artistry of the roaster not the program of a computer. Our blends
      are carefully constructed and not available anywhere else. We invite you
      to experience the difference.
