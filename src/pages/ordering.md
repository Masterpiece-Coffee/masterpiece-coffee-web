              \    Our signature blend and #1 Organic seller is designed to
              provide you with a strong, full-bodied coffee without the
              bitterness associated with dark roasted coffees. Some of our
              clients who prefer Dark Espresso love the North Beach for this
              purpose.

              South America provides a rich and flavorful bean that is roasted
              dark and oily. This premium roast is packed full of smokey flavors
              and a caramel like semi-sweet tang found in dark roasted coffees.
              Still not bitter.

              Our Italian Roast is a blend of The North Beach Blend and our
              French Roast. Slightly more complex and a favorite in many of the
              Whole Food markets that we serve. Bittersweet, bold, and very
              satisfying.

              Balanced acidity, smooth, floral, sweet, nutty and very
              flavorful... The list goes on. Guatemala produces wonderful
              coffees and they are a dream to roast. One of my personal
              favorites. Distinct, chocolatey.

              Several years ago our friends at Gillwoods Café in Napa and St.
              Helena, CA. asked us to work with them and create a blend
              especially for their customers. With their permission we are able
              to offer it to you. Breakfast and Lunch are Gillwoods specialties
              and they do them very well. Regulars and visitors to Napa are fans
              of this coffee, a blend from South America and Indonesia.

              Mocha Java Is the oldest known blend in the world and stuff that
              coffee legends are made of. Originally coffee from Yemen and Java
              were the main components but Yemen is a difficult country to deal
              with and many of us have made substitutions. We have chosen
              Ethiopia. Dry, sweet, chocolately, light, bright fruity. These are
              only a few of the adjectives that have been used to describe this
              exotic coffee.

              Our Maui Select is a fragrant Yellow Caturra sourced directly from
              our friends at Ka’anapali Estate near the historic town of
              Lahaina. We gently roast this bean in small batches to bring out
              the delicate notes imparted by the islands volcanic soil. A truly
              lively and enticing brew.

              Full-bodied and well balanced. Great for your lattes and
              cappuccinos. I have sold our espresso for over twenty years and
              have not changed the formula. If you like European style espresso
              you will love ours. If you like dark, bitter espresso this is not
              for you.
