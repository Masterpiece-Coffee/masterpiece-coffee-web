              Our signature blend and #1 Organic seller is designed to provide
              you with a strong, full-bodied coffee without the bitterness
              associated with dark roasted coffees. Some of our clients who
              prefer Dark Espresso love the North Beach for this purpose.

              South America provides a rich and flavorful bean that is roasted
              dark and oily. This premium roast is packed full of smokey flavors
              and a caramel like semi-sweet tang found in dark roasted coffees.
              Still not bitter.

              Our Italian Roast is a blend of The North Beach Blend and our
              French Roast. Slightly more complex and a favorite in many of the
              Whole Food markets that we serve. Bittersweet, bold, and very
              satisfying.

              Balanced acidity, smooth, floral, sweet, nutty and very
              flavorful... The list goes on. Guatemala produces wonderful
              coffees and they are a dream to roast. One of my personal
              favorites. Distinct, chocolatey.

              Several years ago our friends at Gillwoods CafÃ© in  St. Helena,
              CA. asked us to work with them and create a blend especially for
              their customers. With their permission we are able to offer it to
              you. Breakfast and Lunch are Gillwoods specialties and they do
              them very well. Regulars and visitors to St. Helena are fans of
              this coffee, a blend from South America and Indonesia.
