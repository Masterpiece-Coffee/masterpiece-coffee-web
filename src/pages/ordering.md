              South America provides a rich and flavorful bean that is roasted dark and oily. This premium roast is packed full of smokey flavors and a caramel like semi-sweet tang found in dark roasted coffees. Still not bitter.

              Mocha Java Is the oldest known blend in the world and stuff that coffee legends are made of. Originally coffee from Yemen and Java were the main components but Yemen is a difficult country to deal with and many of us have made substitutions. We have chosen Ethiopia. Dry, sweet, chocolately, light, bright fruity. These are only a few of the adjectives that have been used to describe this exotic coffee.

              Full-bodied and well balanced. Great for your lattes and cappuccinos. I have sold our espresso for over twenty years and have not changed the formula. If you like European style espresso you will love ours. If you like dark, bitter espresso this is not for you.
